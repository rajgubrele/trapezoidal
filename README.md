# trapezoidal
n mathematics, and more specifically in numerical analysis, the trapezoidal rule is a technique for approximating the definite integral. {\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}f(x)\, dx}. The trapezoidal rule works by approximating the region under the graph of the function f(x) as a trapezoid and calculating its area.
